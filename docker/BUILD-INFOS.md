# Docker image build instructions

From the main folder (NFT-Marker-Creator-App) run this command: `docker buildx build -t webarkit/nft-marker-creator-app:<tag> .`
replace `<tag>` with your tag.
Then you can use the image, or upload you own version to docker hub.
Conside that you need to build the image only if you develop your own version, if you want you can use our _webarkit/nft-marker-creator-app_ docker image.
